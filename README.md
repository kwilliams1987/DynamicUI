# Dynamic Blizzard UI

A simple World of Warcraft Addon to automatically switch built in "Edit Mode" profile based on screen resolution.

## How

Create your Edit Mode profiles in either format:

- Strict: {W}x{H} (EG: 1920x1080)
- Loose: {H}p (EG: 1440p)

The addon will scan for a matching profile whenever you log in or the display resolution is changed, it will try to match strict profiles before loose.

## y tho?

This addon was created to resolve an issue I have where my Steam Deck has both a 1280x800 and 1920x1080 resolution, depending on if the external display is connected.

It would similarly also be useful if you have a laptop and sometimes connect to a higher-resolution external display.

I created two separate layouts to maximize screen space on both but I have to manually switch between them and am lazy.
